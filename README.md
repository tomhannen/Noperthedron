This is a Blender file showing the Noperthedron, based on the code here: 

https://www.mapleprimes.com/art/42-The-Noperthedron

I converted it to a Blender python script using an AI chatbot (downloader be warned), then ran the python in Blender to generate the file.

The python script is also uploaded, as is the image showing how it looks.

I removed the centre of the object using a Boolean object and a cylinder shape.
